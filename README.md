# Infinity Trend  

Infinity Trend is a multi-functional Flutter app with features like weather updates, news, a notepad, and a profile page. The app allows users to store and retrieve notes individually, thanks to Firebase integration. It also uses REST APIs to fetch live data for the weather and news. The app follows a state management pattern using Flutter BLoC and Dart.
